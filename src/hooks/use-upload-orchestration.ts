/**
 * Orchestrates the upload lifecycle and state transitions.
 *
 * Single Responsibility: Coordinate active upload â†’ history transition
 *
 * Handles:
 * - Starting uploads and tracking uploaded file metadata
 * - Detecting upload completion
 * - Refreshing history when upload completes
 * - Resetting active upload state
 * - Tracking CIDs that should be auto-expanded in history
 * - Auto-clearing upload state on error after timeout
 *
 * Does NOT:
 * - Render UI (that's components' job)
 * - Store history (that's UploadHistoryContext's job)
 * - Perform uploads (that's useFilecoinUpload's job)
 * - Manage expansion state (that's useUploadExpansion's job)
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * function Content() {
 *   const { startUpload, uploadedFile, activeUpload } = useUploadOrchestration()
 *
 *   return (
 *     <>
 *       <DragNDrop onUpload={startUpload} />

 *           progresses={activeUpload.progress}
